**Generate the SSH keys**
In order to make login process working, you need to generate public and private keys
 
```bash
$ mkdir config/jwt
$ openssl genrsa -out config/jwt/private.pem -aes256 4096
$ openssl rsa -pubout -in config/jwt/private.pem -out config/jwt/public.pem
```

In case first openssl command forces you to input password use following to get the private key decrypted

```bash
$ openssl rsa -in config/jwt/private.pem -out config/jwt/private2.pem
$ mv config/jwt/private.pem config/jwt/private.pem-back
$ mv config/jwt/private2.pem config/jwt/private.pem
```
